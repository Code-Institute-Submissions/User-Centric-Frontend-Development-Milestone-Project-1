# Cottage Tea Rooms

This is a front-end website for 'Cottage Tea Rooms' cafe. 
It is a lovely, historic irish cafe in Old Firhouse Village.
In the website there is information about the cafe itself, options to book a table, 
contact the cafe directly, information about their working hours and their menu/prices.<br>
This website was created as a project for Code Institute.

# UX

The website was built for the customers of the 'Cottage Tea Rooms' for an easy reach of basic information about the cafe
and possibilities to communicate, book a table online. These user stories were made durring planning stage of the
website:

<ul>
<li>As a customer, I want to check the cafe's menu, so that I'd know it suits my taste.</li>
<li>As a customer, I want to book a table online, so I'd be sure I won't need to wait for one.</li>
<li>As a customer, I want to find working hours of the cafe, so I could plan my time.</li>
<li>As a customer, I want to read reviews of the cafe for credibility</li>
</ul>

Also, in the planning stage, I created <a href='#'>these</a> wireframes. 
The design and some features changed over the development process.
